/*
  This header specifies the move byte code which the machine can execute,
  a number of 32 bit words are used to make up each move.

  The structure of a move is (bit number in the header: the word that is included):

Header: 05AAffff
Duration: Number of ticks this move lasts
0: ID 
1: X speed
2: X accel
12&&(1|2): X end pos
3: Y speed
4: Y accel
12&&(3|4): Y end pos
5: Z speed
6: Z accel
12&&(5|6): Z end pos
7: A speed
8: A accel
12&&(7|8): A end pos
13: Switches: bits to set  
13: Switches: bits to clear
9: LASER intensity 
10: LASER intensity acceleration
11: Pixel speed
11: Pixel word count
... pixel word count pixels

The lower 16 bits of the header word (ffff above) signal that the corrosponding
optional word is present in the following data.

If the ID word is omitted, then the id of the move is one higher than the previous one,
the ID is used to provide a progress indication to the controlling host and to assist in
debugging, it's not otherwise significant.

The speed and acceleration values are fixed point, signed values with 30 bits to the
right of the period or Q2.30.

To get the actual speed in steps / tick do: speed >> 30

If a speed is omitted, then it is 0 at the start of the move.

If an acceleration is omitted, then it's 0.

The speed unit is steps per tick, iow steps per 1/50000 seconds.

The acceleraton unit is steps per tick per tick.


When bit 12 is set, then an extra word is emitted for each axis with movement
(speed or acceleration) and the firmware checks that the position after the move matches
the supplied position, if the position doesn't match, an alarm is triggered, this mechanism
is used to validate that the host controllers algorithms match the firmware.


If LASER intensity is present then the laser will be on and it is a packed word consisting of:
0x1A5E00ii

Where ii is the LASER PWM power value, if the LASER is not supposed to be on, do not
set ii to zero, simply omit the LASER intensity word.


If pixel speed is present then it's used to count through the pixels, just like the
other speeds count though steps.

The pixel word count is only there to allow parsing though the moves without doing
any calculation on the pixel speed, it can also be used to sanity check the code.

If pixels are present then the laser word must also be present to set the pwm and enable the laser.
